.Some notes
* Wrapper allows creating Asciidoc files and Habr MarkDown files for publishing at Habr
* Only a subset of Asciidoc directives necessary for the Habr post is implemented
* Applying https://languagetool.org/[Language Tools] during abstract syntax tree construction and throwing exception in the case of grammar error is a quick way to navigate to the source of error via stack trace
* Plus sign (+) in text doesn't mean string concatenation. It is an overloaded operator that adds inline fragment to paragraph object
* To check whether inline text is really inline text and doesn't contain any Asciidoc inline or even block macros, https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctorj/latest/[AsciidoctorJ](Java Bindings for Asciidoctor) is used
* MS Word and pdf outputs are created with the help of https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/asciidoctor-open-document[Open Document converter for Asciidoctor]
